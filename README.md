# CPE400-Project
## Dynamic Routing Protocol to Minimize Energy Consumption
### Final Project for a CPE 400 class at UNR

## Input File
The input file for the program should be a .csv file. For every router, there should be one line in the .csv file. The first value on the line should be the router, and all of the following values should be routers that the router is physically connected to (immediate neighbors). For example, if router b was connected to routers f, i, and k, the entry on that line should be: b,f,i,k .
